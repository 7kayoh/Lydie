**Lydie** is a set of beautifully designed, powerful, and open-source UI components for **Fusion 2.0.**

## Introduction
This is the first iteration of the FrappéUI component library. Created 3 years ago, it was planned to be used in creating Frappé's interfaces for upcoming games and tools.

Now, Frappé no longer uses this version of FrappéUI in favor of another UI framework. I have decided to open source the library under a new name -- Lydie.

## Features

-   :material-format-color-fill:{ .lg .middle } __Theming support__

    ---

    Lydie components were built around theming. Developers can create themes consisting of a custom color scheme and typography set.
    
    Lydie supports hot-switching (thanks to Fusion's reactive states), so you can switch UI themes without having to reload.

-   :material-expand-all:{ .lg .middle } __Extension of existing UI classes__

    ---

    Lydie comes with components to extend the functionalities of native UI classes from Roblox, such as TextBoxes, Buttons, etc.

    Lydie makes full use of the advantages Fusion provides, such as state-first component properties, dynamic theming, and more.

## Why the name Lydie?

The name Lydie comes from one of the playable characters in Atelier Lydie & Suelle –– **Lydie Malen**, apart from being obsessed with the Atelier series, Lydie has a rather unique sense of art, just like this library.
