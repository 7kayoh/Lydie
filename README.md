# Lydie (previously FrappéUI)
Version 1.0

## What is this?
This is the first iteration of the FrappéUI component library. Named after Lydie Malen from Atelier because she has a unique sense of art, so do we when we are creating Lydie.

Created 2-3 years ago, it was originally used for building the interface of Frappé's future games and toolkits.
Powered by Fusion and FusionRouter, it is a powerful component library with features such as hot theme switching.

Anyway, we have moved on and used other libraries due to some circumstances. As a result, this library is now
abandoned and will no longer be used in Frappé. I was not paid for the work put into this library and was initially
started as an unofficial project. I have decided to release this very version of Frappé as open-source software.

Given its creation date, the code and libraries used here are pretty much outdated, but it should still work with some
porting.
